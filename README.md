## Description

This repository contains implementations of three different algorithms: Closest Pair of Points, Domino Tiling (Fold Fulkerson), and Seam Carving. These algorithms are widely used in various fields and are important for solving specific problems efficiently.

## Algorithms

### 1. Closest Pair of Points
The Closest Pair of Points algorithm is used to find the two points in a set that are closest to each other. It has applications in computational geometry, pattern recognition, and data analysis. This implementation returns the distance between the closest pair of points and the second closest pair of points.

### 2. Domino Tiling (Fold Fulkerson)
This Domino Tiling algorithm, using the Ford-Fulkerson max flow algorithm on a bipartite graph, is used to tile a given rectangular grid using dominoes. This algorithm has applications in computer graphics, image processing, and tiling problems. This implentation returns a possible tiling of the board or reveals that there is no possible tiling.

### 3. Seam Carving
Seam Carving is an algorithm used for content-aware image resizing. It intelligently removes or adds seams in an image to resize it while preserving important content. This algorithm is widely used in image editing software and responsive web design. This implentation returns the lowest weight seam for an image.

## Usage

To use any of the algorithms implemented in this repository, run the main.py file in each algorithm's respective directory. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate directory, ensuring easy navigation and understanding.
